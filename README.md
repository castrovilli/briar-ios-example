## Briar

an iPad/iPhone to test and demonstrate the features of the briar gem:

https://github.com/jmoody/briar

briar extends the calabash-ios gem.

### motivation

#### DRY

i have several iOS projects that use calabash-cucumber and i found i was rewriting lots of steps and supporting code.

#### Testing

i want to provide an iOS app that the calabash community can use to test the calabash framework. 

a while back, i tried to port the calabash-ios-server to ARC to fix a leak that was causing one of my tests to occasionally crash.  i did my conversion and realized there was no way to see if my changes broke calabash; there was no app that comprehensively tested all the calabash features.
